"""Decorator.py: Demo code for Decorator functions"""
__author__ = "Sumit Kala"

'''Python developers can extend and modify the behavior of a callable functions, methods or classes without permanently 
modifying the callable itself by using decorators. In short we can say they are callable objects which are used to modify functions or classes.

Function decorators are functions which accepts function references as arguments and adds a wrapper around them and 
returns the function with the wrapper as a new function.'''
